## Introduction
This is a web app to play black jack with a virtual dealer. I made this app for one of the Mintbean Hackathon, but also to solidify my knowledge for front-end development. 

## Rules of Black Jack
- The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
- Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand. 
- Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end. 
- To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn. 
- If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
